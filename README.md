## 100% private

Other pregnancy calendar apps and sites require you to create an account and login, and thereby require you to share your personal data. A pregnancy is something highly personal that you might not be ready to share with your partner or your family, let alone a company you've never heard of before. This site requires absolutely no personal details, requires no account, and allows you to import a personal pregnancy calendar into your own Google or other calendar.

And because there are multiple possible outcomes of a pregnancy, please note that if you import the file as a _new_ calendar, you'll be able to delete it all in one go if you need to.

If this site helps you, please consider a donation to a pregnancy-focused charity such as [Tommy's](https://www.tommys.org/).
